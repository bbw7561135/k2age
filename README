The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is located on the web at
              http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/models/
              
The files within this directory structure contain model tracks generated
using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program (DSEP). All models have 
been evolved to an age of 10 Gyr. Metallicities are GS98 scaled-solar, 
thus [Fe/H] is identical to [M/H] in this instance. Helium abundances 
are computed using the relation
                      Y = Y_prim + 1.6*Z
where Y_prim = 0.245, Z is the current heavy element mass fraction, and
Y is the current helium mass fraction.

Microphysics incorporated in the models include the FreeEOS equation of
state solver (http://freeeos.sourceforge.net) in the EOS4 configuration,
high-temperature OPAL (Iglesias & Rogers '96) and low-temperature
Ferguson et al. ('05) opacities, and helium and heavy element diffusion
according to the prescription of Thoul et al. ('94). Surface boundary
conditions were defined using the PHOENIX AMES-COND (Hauschildt et al.
'99) models atmospheres attached at T=Teff. Nuclear reaction cross-
sections (S-values) were adopted from the Solar Fusion II review 
(Adelberger et al. '10) which did not differ largely from Solar Fusion I
(Adelberger et al. '98) for the p-p chain.

Further details pertraining to the physics incorporated in the models 
may be found in Feiden & Dotter (2013) and references therein.

All mass tracks have the same file structure: two header lines followed 
by the parameters at each evolutionary step. The output files consist of
thirteen (13) space-delimited columns. 

File header, line 1:
       M  :: Mass of model in solar masses
       X  :: Hydrogen mass fraction
       Z  :: Heavy element mass fraction
    COMP  :: Heavy element composition
  [a/Fe]  :: Alpha element abundance relative to iron
    MIXL  :: Convective mixing-length, alpha_MLT
   TURBT  :: Log10 of reference temperature for turbulent diffusion
     CCO  :: Convective core overshoot parameter
     
File header, line 2:
     Age  :: (1)  Age of model (yrs)
   Log T  :: (2)  Log10 of effective temperature (K)
   Log g  :: (3)  Log10 of surface gravity (cgs)
   Log L  :: (4)  Log10 of bolometric luminosity (Lsun)
   Log R  :: (5)  Log10 of stellar radius (Rsun)
  Y_core  :: (6)  Helium mass fraction in the stellar core
  Z_core  :: (7)  Heavy element mass fraction in the stellar core
   (Z/X)  :: (8)  (Z/X) at the stellar surface
     L_H  :: (9)  Luminosity of hydrogen fusion
    L_He  :: (10) Luminosity of helium fusion
    M_He  :: (11) Mass of helium core
    M_CO  :: (12) Mass of carbon/oxygen core
     k_2  :: (13) Interior structure constant

The interpolation software package k2age, written in Python, is provided 
in the source directory, 'src/'. The package will assist in deriving the
age of a binary system using the mean, weighted interior structure 
constants of each star, as described in Feiden & Dotter (2013). Limits 
for use of the routines are 

                      0.15  <  M/Msun  <  0.75
                     -1.00  <  [Fe/H]  <  0.30

and are dependent on the mass tracks provided in the enclosed directory
structure. Extensions in both mass and metallicity are possible with the 
inclusion of more tracks. However, caution is urged if one wishes to 
extend the upper limit on the mass range.

The software has two external Python dependencies: SciPy and Numpy, both
of which are freely available. Note, the software was written and tested
for Python version 2.7 and is likely not compatible with Python 3.0.

A test is available to ensure the Python script is working properly and 
to ensure that the system you are using has the correct dependencies.
While not required for the modules to run, it might save you from having 
a massive headache if other packages are missing. To run, 

  ~$ chmod +x test_interp
  ~$ ./test_interp

This will also give you an idea of how long it takes to run the script 
on your machine. There are multiple ways of running the actual interp
script. 

  1) Add the 'src/' directory to the Python Path environment variable. 
     For Linux and Unix users, this is an addition to your .bashrc or 
     .cshrc file:
     
        bash:
         export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/directory/tracks/src//:$PYTHONPATH

        csh:
         setenv PYTHONPATH=($PYTHONPATH $HOME/directory/tracks/src/)
         
      Performing this method will allow you to call the interpolation
      software from any directory where you launch python. 
      
        ~$ python  
        >> from k2age import *
        
      Once you have imported the k2age package, simply follow the guide
      outlined in the example file, makeBinary.py, in the 'examples/'
      directory. A quick overview of what that script does:
         
        -- Creates an object representative of the model tracks.
        
        -- Creates two stars, the primary and secondary, with particular
           properties specified by the user.
           
        -- Extracts (interpolates) a mass track for each star for the
           specific model set created earlier (here only DSEP).
           
        -- Create a binary system comprised of the two stars that were
           created previously.
        
        -- Convolve the two stellar mass tracks into one single track 
           that shows the evolution of the mean, weighted k2 value.
           
        -- Prints the results to a generic output file.
      
  2) Call the pre-made driver script
        
        ~$ cd $HOME/directory/k2age/
        ~$ python defaultBinary.py *mass_a* *mass_b* *radius_a* *radius_b* 
                                   *metallicity* *eccentricity* *semi_major_axis*

Take a look at the defaultBinary.py for a description of the individual
variables. While the driver script defaultBinary.py works, it is not as 
flexible compared to designing your own script similar to defaultBinary
or the example makeBinary. There are not many routines outside of what 
is contained in makeBinary, but as the software develops, more will be 
available. Currently, the software is written for the enclosed directory 
structure and requires the given structure to locate the mass tracks.
