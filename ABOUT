The stellar evolution tracks contained within the directory structure
were utilized in the ApJ paper: Feiden & Dotter (2013). Not all models
are explicitly illustrated in the paper, but are provided here for 
future use and for use with the mass/metallicity interpolator.

Additional models may be provided upon request.
